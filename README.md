## Overview
Minibox is a CLI  (**C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface) that allows you to quickly make containers, or _boxes_, so you can work in the exact same environment at any time.
A nice side effect of this function is that you can also use Minibox as a tool to run programs from different Linux distrobutions.

*\*This is the minimum kernel version for podman, please make an issue if this is incorrect/Minibox doesn't work with 3.10**
